# Ranking object detection papers by citation
## Bounding box, semantic and instance segmentation
Last updated: 18 june 2019

List of algorithms (papers with open source code) researched for object detection (bounding box, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation). This repository is mainly used as a citation reference for my master's dissertation. 

There are three TXT files, each containing data for bounding box, semantic segmentation or instance segmentation. Inside the TXT files, data is organized in a CSV style, with the first column being the year the paper was published, the second the number of cites it had at the time I searched for it and the third column the main name of the algorithm.

There is also a Python script that generates the charts shown in my master's document which highlights the top x% most cited papers, in such a way that visualization of the most relevant works is easy to see.
