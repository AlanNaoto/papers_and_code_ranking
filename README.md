# papers_and_code_ranking
List of algorithms (papers with open source code) researched for object detection (bounding box, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation).
This repository is mainly used as a citation reference for my master's dissertation. There are three TXT files, each containing data for bounding box, semantic segmentation or instance segmentation. Inside the TXT files, data is organized in a CSV style, with the first column being the year the paper was published, the second the number of cites it had at the time I searched for it and the third column the main name of the algorithm.
